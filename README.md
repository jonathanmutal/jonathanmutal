## 🧪 My PhD Work

As part of the [PictoDr](https://www.unige.ch/pictodr) and [BabelDr](https://babeldr.unige.ch) projects, I evaluate and develop multilingual machine translation systems to support communication between healthcare providers and patients.  
My dissertation is titled:  
**“Evaluating Large Language Models for Low-Resource Multilingual Machine Translation in Medical Interactions.”**

Highlights:
- Translation into over **140 language combinations**, including pictographs
- Focus on **zero-shot, few-shot learning** translation using LLMs
- Including biomedical terminology to improve translation quality using LLM
- Design and analysis of **human evaluations** (adequacy, fluency, usability)
- Statistical modeling of performance across domains and languages

## 🔍 Current Focus

I'm currently:
- Finalizing my PhD 🧑‍🎓  
- Publishing and releasing research tools and datasets on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/UNIGE)  
- Exploring opportunities to apply my research in **industry**, particularly in **health tech**, **AI for translation**, or **R&D leadership roles**
