# 👋 Hi, I'm Jonathan Mutal

I'm a researcher, developer, and PhD candidate at the Faculty of Translation and Interpreting (FTI), University of Geneva 🇨🇭. I specialize in **multilingual machine translation for medical communication**, with a focus on low-resource languages, human evaluation, and the use of large language models.

---

## 🧠 Research Focus

- 🏥 **Machine Translation for Medical Interactions**
- 🌍 **Low-Resource and Multilingual NLP**
- 🤖 **Large Language Models (LLMs), In-Context Learning**
- 🧾 **Human Evaluation & Semantic Metrics**
- 🔁 **Instruction Tuning, Domain Adaptation, RAG**

My dissertation is titled:  
**"Evaluating Large Language Models for Low-Resource Multilingual Machine Translation in Medical Interactions"**  
As part of the [PictoDr](https://www.unige.ch/pictodr) and [BabelDr](https://babeldr.unige.ch) projects, I evaluate and build translation systems for over 140 language combinations — including translation into pictographs — to support communication between healthcare providers and patients.
